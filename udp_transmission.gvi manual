We need two desktops, one(say system A) with Labview NXG 3.1.1 and VLC media player installed and 
another (system B--we do not need Labview but only VLC here). Both system-A and system-B need to be connected on same subnet and must
be pingable from each other.
In system A, in the script udp_transmission.gvi, we first do the following settings:
S-1: Find ip of A and put it here.
S-2: Put the UDP port number, put anything.
S-3: ip of system-B which is the destination.
S-4: UDP port at destination, chose anything. 
S-5: Put same ip as S-1.
S-6: Put any port number, insignificant.
Now we can do two tests 1. VLC media streaming 2. iperf test

VLC media streaming
1. Open VLC media player in system-A.
2. Click on Media(top left), go to Stream.
3. Add a media file, i.e., video/audo which you want to broadcast.
4. Click on stream, then Next.
5. In the New Destination, chose udp from the drop down and add.
6. Put the IP address of system-A (S-1) and port number (S-2) and then Next.
7. Check on activate transcoding and chose the format. For video MPEG-2+MPEG(TS) is good, for audio use any mp3 format.
8. Click next and then stream.
9. In system-B, open a VLC media player.
10. Click on Media, then Open network stream.
11. In the network url field, enter udp://@<ip of system-2>:<port of system-2>. Do not enter the -- "<>"
12. Click play.

Now run the udp_transmission.gvi in system-A and you should be able to see the video on system-B.

iperf test
1. Install iperf version-2 (not 3) on both system-A and B. https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php
2. This test was conducted using iperf 2.0.9. 
3. On system-B open command window and type the following and hit enter 
4. iperf -s -u -p <S-4 port>
5. On System-A open command window and hit enter the following
6. iperf -c <S-1 ip address> -u -p <S-2 port> -l 200
7. Now run the udp_transmission.gvi on system-A
8. After some seconds, you shoud be able to see the network throughput on system-B
